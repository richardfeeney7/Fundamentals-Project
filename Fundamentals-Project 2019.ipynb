    "The Two main features in Seaborn to visualize the linear relationships determined by regression are regplot() and lmplot() and are closely related and share most of the core functionality. However, it's important to understand how they are different. The two functions plot a scatter plot of two variables x and y, then fit the regression model y~x and plot the regression line and 95% confidence interval for the regression line. <i>(Tutorialspoint.com, 2019)</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "How the relationship changes between these two variables change when we add a third variable is the difference between regplot() and lmplot(). regplot() always shows a single relationship, lmplot() combines regplot() with FacetGrid to provide a simple interface that displays linear regression. According to (Tutorialspoint.com, 2019), \"The FacetGrid class helps in visualizing the distribution of one variable as well as the relationship between multiple variables separately within subsets of your dataset using multiple panels.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section I will be looking at how the total bill affects tip. Y will be the independent and X will be the dependent. I will be specifying a hue so the output will display one and two regressions in the scatter plots. When implementing the lmplot this will display four plots in total, this is great for doing multiple regressions and analysis across many categorical data points and trying to find relationships. I will also have a summary at the end of each day displaying how many people were in the restaurant and what was the total bill and total tips received."

    " \n",
    "In conclusion to this project I found that overall, I would like to analysis more of this data to look at trends that I noticed during my investigations. It was interesting to note that on Thursday the business only had one booking for dinner. At first, I was thinking that maybe they had a private booking for Dinner but looking at the results from my plots I can see that during this time the total bill cost was 18.78 dollars, and it would not be possible to book a restaurant privately without paying something to cover overheads. Maybe it was this a slow afternoon, if it is a regular occurrence this would not be financially beneficial to ignore this. If this was a regular occurrence maybe they could try some promotional ideas to try attracting customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Friday was a busy day because they had customers for both Lunch and Dinner but the overall total bill of 325.88 dollars was very low compared to the other days. Saturday and Sunday as expected would be the busiest day. During my investigation I noticed that they did not record any customers during Lunch on both days. Wonder was the restaurant closed in the morning and maybe opened later Saturday and Sunday when the footfall would be higher. With regards to the staff working they days, the tip percentage averaged between fourteen and sixteen dollars over all days with Saturday generating the highest number of tips that was 260.40 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "From my finding we can see that the restaurant had 157 Male and 87 Female customers (244 total). From the total of 244 customers they had 60 male smokers and 33 female smokers. The total tips received from smokers was higher from men but this can be expected as the amount of male smokes was almost double. The total amount of smokers (Male and Female) was 93 while the total amount of non smokers(Male and Female) was 152 and we can see that the total amount of tips was higher from non smokers but this would be expected as more customers did not smoke. I have broken down each day into different regression plots and we can see that in most cases the tip increases when the total bill is higher."
